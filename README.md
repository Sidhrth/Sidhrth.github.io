# PhD CS Student at UMass 

### About me & Research Interests
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction in healthcare. My academic journey spans from a bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at Mumbai University, India, to a master's in Computer Science from the University of Geneva, Switzerland.
My research centers on developing technological solutions for individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). I conduct needs assessments with ADRD patients and investigate cognitive impairment detection methodologies. My work also explores practice effects in cognitive assessments among older adults, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy. 
Through my research, I strive to create practical, human-centered solutions that enhance patients' and their caregivers' quality of life. I welcome collaborations and discussions about potential research initiatives in these areas.
I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. Ravi Karkar.
